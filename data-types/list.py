"""
Lists are a collection of arbitrary objects, just like arrays in other programming languages. 

Lists are ordered. 

Lists are accessed using the idnex - which starts at 0.

Lists are mutable and dynamic which means they can be modified after their creation.

Example:
    list = ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', '0', 'N']
    list[3] = 'h'
